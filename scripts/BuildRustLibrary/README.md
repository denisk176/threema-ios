# BuildRustLibrary

This contains a script to build a Rust library and create the Swift bindings for it using [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io).

## Usage

It can be directly called from the command line. (If you invoke it without any argument it will print usage information.)

```sh
./BuildRustLibrary/Sources/BuildRustLibraryScript/main.swift
```

## Development

To change the script open this package for a better editing experience in Xcode and to add and run tests.
