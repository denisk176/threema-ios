/// This Wrapper makes it possible to take any notification and observe its publisher for new values.
///
/// There are two main things that happen here:
/// 1. Using a `CurrentValueSubject` to store the value
///     This is needed as a classic publisher might fire before it has any subscribers receiving the published value.
/// 2. Storing the published state via `hasBeenSent` to make sure the the value gets only published once and gets
///     "deleted" after at least one subscriber received it.
///     This is achieved via setting the `hasBeenSent` to false on the publisher and true on the subject. Also we need
///     to map the subject to an Empty Publisher once `hasBeenSent` is set to true.
///     Without this, the subscribers of the subjects publisher would receive a never ending stream of the same value.
